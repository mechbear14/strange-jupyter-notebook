# The Strange Use Cases of Jupyter Notebook
Presentation slides and code examples
Presented on 21AUG20 by Gabe Lyu

## The three strange use cases
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Canvas to control plotting
- Live code in presentation

## Code examples
- lib/my_library.py  Library imported in all examples
- IYDK.ipynb         If you don't know Jupyter Notebook
- Example1.ipynb     Super bear creation (GUI) example
- Example2.ipynb     Line drawing example
- Example3.ipynb     Presentation example

## Dependencies
See requirements.txt. You will need to `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Todo
- Remove global variables
- Bug in Example2: variation is normalised, so it's always huge
- Refactor into classes
- Think of a way for easy integration
